# How to run

## Build and Run
1. `npm run build`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Or Watch for changes
1. `npm run watch`
2. Open `index.html` in browser.
3. Make change in code. 
The browser won't reload on it's own since no http-server is set up, but reloading the page will get the latest changes.
